# Color-Memory Game

This is a simple game in which you have to remember which color you have chosen previously. I used this project to dwell
deeper in the concepts I learned in react while following [Scrimba Front-End Developer Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

The project is full of ES5 functions as while I was doing this I was still learining and I still felt confortable seeing
them as functions:)

When I felt confident I used the arrow functions. I am fully aware that in a real-world project they should be kept
consistent.

I have also only commented out the console.logs as I still visit the project sometimes to play with the components.
